Debugging a Driver
==================

Typically, debugging a kernel-mode driver requires two computers. The debugger runs on the *host computer*, and the code being debugged runs on the *target computer*. The target computer is also called the *test computer*. You can debug a user-mode driver on the host computer or on a separate target computer. Before you can debug a driver running on a target computer, you must configure the target computer for debugging.

For information about configuring a target computer and setting up a debug cable, see [Setting Up Kernel-Mode Debugging in Visual Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh439376) and [Provision a computer for driver deployment and testing (WDK 8.1)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Dn745909).

This video demonstrates how to use the WinDbg debugging engine directly in Visual Studio instead of running WinDbg separately.
