Testing a Driver
================

The WDK adds a driver testing interface to Visual Studio that allows you to conveniently build, deploy, install, and test a driver on a remote test computer on your network. The WDK also provides a collection of device driver tests that you can use to test features and functions of your driver. You can also write customize or write your own driver tests using the Driver Test Template in Visual Studio.

This section describes some strategies for testing driver, and information about how you select and configure a remote computer to use for testing.

To prepare a driver for public distribution, you should run the [Windows Hardware Certification Kit (HCK)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=254893). For information about the Windows Certification program and how to obtain the HCK, see [Windows Hardware Certification Program](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=227016).

<td align="left"><p><strong>When should you start testing?</strong> As soon as you have the requirements for your driver, you can begin to design test cases to test that the critical requirements have been implemented. Studies show that finding and fixing defects in code becomes more expensive the longer the defects remain in the code. Finding and fixing defects early in the development cycle is less costly and disruptive than finding defects after the code has been released and distributed. Creating your test cases early can also help you find problems in your design.</p>
