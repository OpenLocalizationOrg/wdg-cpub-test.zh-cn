How to create a custom driver installation script
=================================================

If your deployment scenario requires more than installing the driver package on the test computers, you can choose to run your own custom command scripts upon installation.

-   Driver package that is test signed and ready to install. You must first create and build your driver and then create a driver package for installation. For more information, see [Building a Driver](building_a_driver.md) and [Creating a Driver Package](creating_a_driver_package.md).
-   Test computers that are configured and provisioned for deployment. See [How to test a driver at runtime using Visual Studio](testing_a_driver_at_runtime.md).

From the project property pages for your driver package, you can configure whether you want to automatically deploy a driver package on a test computer. You can also run a custom installation script from these pages. You can choose to deploy the driver automatically whenever you build the driver solution in each configuration. For more information about deployment, see [Deploying a Driver to a Test Computer](deploying_a_driver_to_a_test_computer.md) and [Deployment Properties for Driver Projects](deployment_properties_for_driver_projects.md).

1.  Open the property pages for your driver package project. Right-click the driver project in Solution Explorer and select **Properties**.

2.  In the property pages for the driver package, click **Configuration Properties**, click **Driver Settings**, and then click **Deployment**.

3.  Click **Enable deployment** and then select the test computer to use.

4.  Click **Custom Command Line**. In the box, type custom command scripts that you want to run upon installation.

5.  In the **Additional Files** text box, add the command script and other installation files to be copied to the test computer. When the driver is deployed, the additional files are copied to the *%Systemdrive%*\\drivertest\\drivers folder on the remote computer.
