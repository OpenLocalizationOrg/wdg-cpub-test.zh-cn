Creating a Device Metadata Package
==================================

You can create a Device Metadata Package for your device directly in Visual Studio. The Device Metadata Authoring Wizard, located in the **Driver** menu, allows you to author specific information that appears to end users in Windows, including the icon and name for your device. It also allows you to associate a Windows Store device app to your device, which gets installed automatically when a user first connects the device.

For more information about how to use the Device Metadata Authoring Wizard, please see [Device Metadata Authoring Wizard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/Library/Windows/Hardware/Hh454213).
