# Table creation tools and tips

Markdown is generally quick and easy to author, but creating tables is a well-known challenge.

Before looking at tooling to help create tables, it's worth knowing how to author them natively in GitHub-flavored markdown ("strict" markdown does not provide any table support, but GitHub does support them):
* [GitHub-flavored markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables).

There are some **web-based** tools that will allow you build your table online and then copy and paste the resulting markdown into your editor. Here is one:
* [Markdown Tables Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) -- It can also general tables in HTML and LaTeX

Different markdown editors handle tables with different levels of sophistication. Here are some options:
* [MarkdownPad Pro](http://www.markdownpad.com/) has very good table support, but you'll need to pay have the $15 Pro version for GitHub-flavored markdown support.
* [Atom](http://atom.io) has an add-in package called **markdown-table-formatter** that lets you create a table via GUI.
